NILDO Compiler - C Scripting Everywhere - The Smallest ANSI C compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:
--------

- SMALL! You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for example on
  rescue disks.

- FAST! nld generates optimized x86 code. No byte code
  overhead. Compile, assemble and link about 7 times faster than 'gcc
  -O0'.

- UNLIMITED! Any C dynamic library can be used directly. NILDO is
  heading torward full ISOC99 compliance. NILDO can of course compile
  itself.

- SAFE! nld includes an optional memory and bound checker. Bound
  checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.

- Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly
  necessary. Full C preprocessor included. 

- C script supported : just add '#!/usr/local/bin/nld -run' at the first
  line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command
  line.

1) Installation on a i386/x86_64/arm Linux/OSX/FreeBSD host

   ./configure
   make
   make test
   make install

   Notes: For OSX and FreeBSD, gmake should be used instead of make.
   For Windows read nld-win32.txt.

makeinfo must be installed to compile the doc.  By default, nld is
installed in /usr/local/bin.  ./configure --help  shows configuration
options.


2) Introduction

We assume here that you know ANSI C. Look at the example ex1.c to know
what the programs look like.

The include file <nldlib.h> can be used if you want a small basic libc
include support (especially useful for floppy disks). Of course, you
can also use standard headers, although they are slower to compile.

You can begin your C script with '#!/usr/local/bin/nld -run' on the first
line and set its execute bits (chmod a+x your_script). Then, you can
launch the C code as a shell or perl script :-) The command line
arguments are put in 'argc' and 'argv' of the main functions, as in
ANSI C.

3) Examples

ex1.c: simplest example (hello world). Can also be launched directly
as a script: './ex1.c'.

ex2.c: more complicated example: find a number with the four
operations given a list of numbers (benchmark).

ex3.c: compute fibonacci numbers (benchmark).

ex4.c: more complicated: X11 program. Very complicated test in fact
because standard headers are being used ! As for ex1.c, can also be launched
directly as a script: './ex4.c'.

ex5.c: 'hello world' with standard glibc headers.

nld.c: NILDO can of course compile itself. Used to check the code
generator.

nldtest.c: auto test for NILDO which tests many subtle possible bugs. Used
when doing 'make test'.
